# AI Business Dashboard Challenge
## Summit Construction LLC

---

**The Scenario:** Lucas Buckeye owns Summit Construction LLC, a small residential construction company. He's been tracking projects, materials, and labor in a spreadsheet — but he has no idea what the data is telling him. He needs your help turning raw numbers into useful business insights.

**Your Role:** You're his data consultant. Use AI (Gemini or Copilot) to analyze his data and give him something he can actually use.

**Don't have any idea what to do here?** Have a conversation with AI about what you need to get done, check out some data dashboards online, try and work through a thorough conversation with Gemini or CoPilot about what do to answer these questions.  Give it the data, ask what it thinks about **VISUALIZATION** that helps inform the business owner.

### The Data (3 Sheets)

| Sheet | What's In It |
|-------|-------------|
| **Projects** | Project type, budget vs. actual cost, crew lead, on-time status, satisfaction rating |
| **Materials** | Material type, supplier, unit cost, quantities, total spend |
| **Labor** | Worker roles, hourly rates, hours per project, crew assignments |

---

### Pick 2 Tasks

**Task 1 — Project Performance:** Which project types make money? Which crew leads deliver on time and on budget? Create a chart showing project profitability.

**Task 2 — Materials & Costs:** Which suppliers give the best prices? What materials eat up the most budget? Show Lucas where he can save money.

**Task 3 — Labor Efficiency:** Which roles cost the most? How do labor costs compare across project types? Find out if any crews are more efficient than others.

**Task 4 — Executive Summary:** Write Lucas a one-page summary with 3-5 clear recommendations backed by data. Keep it short — he's busy.
