    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a class called `TextAnalyzer`\n",
    "- Constructor takes text as parameter\n",
    "- Implement methods:\n",
    "  - `wordCount()` → returns int\n",
    "  - `sentenceCount()` → returns int\n",
    "  - `averageWordLength()` → returns float (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n",
    "  - `mostCommonWord()` → returns str (the word, all lowercase)\n",
    "  - `longestWord()` → returns str (the word, preserving original case)\n",
    "  - `analyze()` → prints a formatted report\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rules**:\n",
    "  - Remove punctuation before analyzing\n",
    "  - Treat uppercase/lowercase as the same word (lowercase for comparison)\n",
    "  - Sentences end with `.`, `!`, or `?`\n",
    "  - Words are separated by spaces\n",
