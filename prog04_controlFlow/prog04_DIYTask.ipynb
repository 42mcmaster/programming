    "## Project: Number Guessing Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a complete number guessing game where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100\n",
    "2. The player guesses the number\n",
    "3. The program gives hints: \"Too high\" or \"Too low\"\n",
    "4. Count the number of attempts\n",
    "5. When the player guesses correctly, show the number of attempts and ask if they want to play again\n",
    "6. Keep playing until the user says no\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features Required:\n",
    "- Import the `random` module to generate random numbers\n",
    "- Use conditionals (if/elif/else) for hints\n",
    "- Use loops (while, for) for game flow\n",
    "- Use an accumulator pattern to count attempts\n",
    "- Use input validation to ensure valid guesses\n",
    "- Use a sentinel loop to allow multiple games\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\n",
    "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guess the number: 50\n",
    "Too high! Try again.\n",
    "Guess the number: 25\n",
    "Too low! Try again.\n",
    "Guess the number: 37\n",
    "Correct! You got it in 3 attempts!\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you want to play again? (yes/no): no\n",
    "Thanks for playing!\n",
