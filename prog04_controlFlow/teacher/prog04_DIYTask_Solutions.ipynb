    "## Instructor Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**\n",
    "1. **Nested loops:** Outer loop for multiple games, inner loop for single game, validation loop inside\n",
    "2. **Accumulator pattern:** attempts counter\n",
    "3. **Input validation:** Multiple checks (is digit, in range, yes/no)\n",
    "4. **Conditional logic:** if/elif/else for feedback\n",
    "5. **Sentinel loops:** while True with break\n",
    "6. **Random module:** random.randint()\n",
    "7. **String methods:** .isdigit(), .lower()\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Increases:**\n",
    "- 3 nested while loops (play multiple games > play one game > input validation)\n",
    "- Multiple break statements at different levels\n",
    "- State tracking (attempts counter)\n",
    "- User experience (hints, feedback, replay)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Extensions:**\n",
    "- Track best score (fewest attempts)\n",
    "- Difficulty levels (range 1-50, 1-1000)\n",
    "- Display hint (e.g., \"Hint: the number is even\")\n",
    "- Implement turn limit (max 10 attempts)\n",
    "- Save high scores to a file"
