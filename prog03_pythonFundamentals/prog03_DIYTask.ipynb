    "## Challenge: Create a \"Personal Info Card\" Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that collects information about yourself and displays a formatted \"card.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inputs** (get from user):\n",
    "   - Full name (string)\n",
    "   - Age (integer)\n",
    "   - Favorite hobby (string)\n",
    "   - Number of pets (integer)\n",
    "   - Average grade in this class (float)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculations**:\n",
    "   - Calculate the year you'll graduate (current year + 4 - age)\n",
    "   - Calculate your pet to person ratio (pets per year of age)\n",
    "   - Calculate a \"grade percentage\" (grade as a percentage, e.g., 3.8 GPA = 95%)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output** (display as a formatted card):\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   Age: [Age]\n",
    "   Favorite Hobby: [Hobby]\n",
    "   Number of Pets: [Pets]\n",

    "   Current Average: [Grade]\n",
    "   Grade Percentage: [Percent]%\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Expected Graduation Year: [Year]\n",
    "   Pets per Year of Age: [Ratio]\n",
    "   ========================================\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips:\n",
    "- Use f-strings for all output\n",
    "- Use `:.2f` to format decimals to 2 places\n",
    "- Use `int()` to convert floats to integers where needed (like year)\n",
    "- Consider using a constant for the current year\n",
